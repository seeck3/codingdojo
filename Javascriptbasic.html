               <h1 class="mainhead">JavaScript Basics</h1>
               <p class="mainpara">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.  JavaScript
                   is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.  It is a small and lightweight language allowing
                   maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of differnt directions.  JavaScript 
                   lives inside a host enviroment (a web brower or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these enviroments to provide programmatic control over them.

               <ul>
                   <li id="mainlist"><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables 
                    are containers for storing data values - imagine a 
                    cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, 
                    a variable holds a value.  All JavaScript variables 
                    must be identified with unique names.  These unique 
                    names are called identifiers.   var x;</li>
                    <br>
                <li id="mainlist"><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> 
                    Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript 
                    variables - out cup can now have coffee poured in it, 
                    giving our variable a value to hold.  The = assignment 
                    operator assigns a value to a varriable.  var x = 10;</li>
                    <br>
                <li id="mainlist"><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an
                    important concept; to be able to operate on variables you 
                    need to know the data type.  There are six data types 
                    that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or 
                    false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; 
                    String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array - [1, 'Coding', 
                    2, 'Dojo;]; and Object - {first_name: 'Jane', 
                    last_name: 'Doe'}</li>
                    <br>
                <li id="mainlist"><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When 
                    you write code, you want to perform different actions 
                    for different decisions - hitting different code blocks 
                    based on values or conditions that have been met.  
                    You can use conditional statements in your code to 
                    accomplish this.  there are the collowing conditional 
                    statements:  if a specified condition is true, do this 
                    code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition 
                    to test, if the first condition is fals; else we execute 
                    this block of code;</li>
                    <br>
                <li id="mainlist"><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many 
                    different kinds of loops in very programming language, 
                    but they all essentially do the same thing: they will 
                    repeat an action some number of times.  Imagine you have 
                    to run a mile, well you run around the track four times 
                    and then you stop.  That's a loop!</li>
                    <br>
                <li id="mainlist"><a href="#">Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block.  when we call our function this will run that code block.  Think of it as a list of instruction.  As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done!  We finished out instruction.  Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so let's call our function over and over and over again.</li>
